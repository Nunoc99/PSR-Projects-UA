# PSR-Projects-UA
Some projects of "Robotics Systems Programming"  that were developed while doing my master's degree in Industrial Automation Engineering


All the projects in the folders PSR_TP3 and psr22 are related to ROS programming, to run those you have to have the ROS installed and having them in the
catkin_ws/src folder of ubuntu.
Using those keys: roslaunch, roscore, rviz, blablabla
